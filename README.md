# Boggle
NOTE ::: HELP OF A DESIGNER WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

Boggle is a word game originally invented by Allan Turoff in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.

How to play?
-> Click on the start game button. The empty 4*4 matrix is populated by some random letters and timer will also start at that same time.
-> You can then enter the words you can form from letters on the board
-> The adjacent letters of the word you formed should also be adjacent in the boggle board

For example:

-> In the board above, as shown, the word "SUPER" is valid. Similarly "GLUE" would also be a valid word while "LIE" would be an invalid word as the letters are not connected(adjacent) on the example board
One letter of the same cell cannot be used twice. "STUNT" would be invalid as the letter "T" is used twice from same location. "GLEE" is valid because there are 2 E's in the board.

-> Score for a correct word will be equal to the length of the word.

-> Click on restart button if you wish to restart the game
